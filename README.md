# Redux

- See the index.js, a simple redux demo program.

- It's important for every beginer, we need to stress that Redux has no relation to React. You can write Redux apps with React, Angular, Ember, jQuery, or vanilla JavaScript.

- Make all triggers unidirectional from store to subscribed callback.
